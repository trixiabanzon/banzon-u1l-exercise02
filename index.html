            Splash Frenzy: The Amazing Mouse Chase is a game that
            tests the player's reflexes as they navigate their way through
            the world brimming with devious enemy cats.
            Armed with only a water gun, players must take control of the 
            brave Little Mouse to fight off its cunning foes, and ultimately 
            defeat the frightening Big Boss Cat within the allotted time.

          This is a personal project made for my partner. I made this using HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript. It is a simple website that uses buttons to proceed to 
          the next part. I added a feature that everytime you click the button "No",
          it will travel across the screen. In short, the user has no option but to
          pick the button "Yes" instead.

          This is an another personal project made for my partner for Valentine's.
          I made this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One notable feature is that everytime you
          click "No", the "Yes" button will get bigger and bigger until it takes over the user's 
          screen, forcing them to click "Yes".

        <p>
          My name is Trixia Mae E. Banzon and I was born on the 18th of July, 2003
          in Cavite. I was raised in Marikina City.
          I am currently studying at UPLB. I was fortunate enough to be studying here.
          Everything has been going well so far. I like my course, and I made friends
          not only with my coursemates but also those who are in other courses as well.
